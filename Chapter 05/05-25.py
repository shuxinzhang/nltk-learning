â—‘ Obtain some tagged data for another language, and train and
evaluate a variety of taggers on it.  If the language is
morphologically complex, or if there are any orthographic clues
(e.g. capitalization) to word classes, consider developing a
regular expression tagger for it (ordered after the unigram
tagger, and before the default tagger).  How does the accuracy of
your tagger(s) compare with the same taggers run on English data?
Discuss any issues you encounter in applying these methods to the language.'''
