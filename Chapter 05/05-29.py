Recall the example of a bigram tagger which encountered a word it hadn't
seen during training, and tagged the rest of the sentence as None.
It is possible for a bigram tagger to fail part way through a sentence
even if it contains no unseen words (even if the sentence was used during
training).  In what circumstance can this happen?  Can you write a program
to find some examples of this?'''
