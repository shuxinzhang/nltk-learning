â—‘ Explore the following issues that arise in connection with the lookup tagger:
What happens to the tagger performance for the various
model sizes when a backoff tagger is omitted?
Consider the curve in 4.2; suggest a
good size for a lookup tagger that balances memory and performance.
Can you come up with scenarios where it would be preferable to
minimize memory usage, or to maximize performance with no regard for memory usage?
