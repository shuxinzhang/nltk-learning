â˜… Develop a simple extractive summarization tool, that prints the
sentences of a document which contain the highest total word
frequency.  Use FreqDist() to count word frequencies, and use
sum to sum the frequencies of the words in each sentence.
Rank the sentences according to their score.  Finally, print the n
highest-scoring sentences in document order.  Carefully review the
design of your program, especially your approach to this double
sorting.  Make sure the program is written as clearly as possible.
