â—‘ Write a recursive function lookup(trie, key) that looks up a key in a trie,
and returns the value it finds.  Extend the function to return a word when it is uniquely
determined by its prefix (e.g. vanguard is the only word that starts with vang-,
so lookup(trie, 'vang') should return the same thing as lookup(trie, 'vanguard')).
