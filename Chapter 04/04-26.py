◑ The Catalan numbers arise in many applications of combinatorial mathematics,
including the counting of parse trees (6).  The series
can be defined as follows: C0 = 1, and
Cn+1 = Σ0..n (CiCn-i).

Write a recursive function to compute nth Catalan number Cn.
Now write another function that does this computation using dynamic programming.
Use the timeit module to compare the performance of these functions as n
increases.
