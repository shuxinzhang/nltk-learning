◑ Develop a method for translating English sentences into
formulas with binary generalized quantifiers. In such an
approach, given a generalized quantifier Q, a quantified
formula is of the form Q(A, B), where both A and B are
expressions of type 〈e, t〉. Then, for example,
all(A, B) is true iff A denotes a subset of what B denotes.
