â˜… Select three or four contiguous sentences from a book for children. A possible
source of examples are the collections of stories in
nltk.corpus.gutenberg: bryant-stories.txt,
burgess-busterbrown.txt and
edgeworth-parents.txt. Develop a grammar which will allow your
sentences to be translated into first order logic, and build a
model which will allow those translations to be checked for truth
or falsity.
