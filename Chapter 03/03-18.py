â—‘ Read in some text from a corpus, tokenize it, and print the list of
all wh-word types that occur.  (wh-words in English
are used in questions, relative clauses and exclamations:
who, which, what, and so on.) Print
them in order.  Are any words duplicated in this list, because of
the presence of case distinctions or punctuation?
