â—‘ The index() function can be used to look up items in sequences.
For example, 'inexpressible'.index('e') tells us the index of the
first position of the letter e.

What happens when you look up a substring, e.g. 'inexpressible'.index('re')?
Define a variable words containing a list of words.  Now use words.index()
to look up the position of an individual word.
Define a variable silly as in the exercise above.
Use the index() function in combination with list slicing to
build a list phrase consisting of all the words up to (but not
including) in in silly.
