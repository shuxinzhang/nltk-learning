â—‘ Create a file consisting of words and (made up) frequencies, where each
line consists of a word, the space character, and a positive integer,
e.g. fuzzy 53.  Read the file into a Python list using open(filename).readlines().
Next, break each line into its two fields using split(), and
convert the number into an integer using int().  The result should
be a list of the form: [['fuzzy', 53], ...].
