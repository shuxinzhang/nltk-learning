◑ Try to write code to convert text into hAck3r, using regular expressions
and substitution, where
e → 3,
i → 1,
o → 0,
l → |,
s → 5,
. → 5w33t!,
ate → 8.
Normalize the text to lowercase before converting it.
Add more substitutions of your own.  Now try to map
s to two different values: $ for word-initial s,
and 5 for word-internal s.
