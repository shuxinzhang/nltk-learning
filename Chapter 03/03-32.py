â—‘ Define a variable silly to contain the string:
'newly formed bland ideas are inexpressible in an infuriating
way'.  (This happens to be the legitimate interpretation that
bilingual English-Spanish speakers can assign to Chomsky's
famous nonsense phrase, colorless green ideas sleep furiously
according to Wikipedia).  Now write code to perform the following tasks:

Split silly into a list of strings, one per
word, using Python's split() operation, and save
this to a variable called bland.
Extract the second letter of each word in silly and join
them into a string, to get 'eoldrnnnna'.
Combine the words in bland back into a single string, using join().
Make sure the words in the resulting string are separated with
whitespace.
Print the words of silly in alphabetical order, one per line.
