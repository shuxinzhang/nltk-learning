â—‘ Python's random module includes a function choice() which
randomly chooses an item from a sequence, e.g. choice("aehh ") will
produce one of four possible characters, with the letter h being
twice as frequent as the others.  Write a generator expression
that produces a sequence of 500 randomly chosen letters drawn from the
string "aehh ", and put this
expression inside a call to the ''.join() function, to concatenate
them into one long string.  You should get a result that looks like
uncontrolled sneezing or maniacal laughter: he  haha ee  heheeh eha.
Use split() and join() again to normalize the whitespace in
this string.
