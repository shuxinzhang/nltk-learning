â˜¼ What is the difference between calling split on a string
with no argument or with ' ' as the argument,
e.g. sent.split() versus sent.split(' ')?  What happens
when the string being split contains tab characters, consecutive
space characters, or a sequence of tabs and spaces?  (In IDLE you
will need to use '\t' to enter a tab character.)
