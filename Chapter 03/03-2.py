â˜¼ We can use the slice notation to remove morphological endings on
words.  For example, 'dogs'[:-1] removes the last character of
dogs, leaving dog.  Use slice notation to remove the
affixes from these words (we've inserted a hyphen to
indicate the affix boundary, but omit this from your strings):
dish-es, run-ning, nation-ality, un-do,
pre-heat.
