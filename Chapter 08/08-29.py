â˜… One common way of defining the subject of a sentence S in
English is as the noun phrase that is the child of S and
the sibling of VP.   Write a function that takes the tree for
a sentence and returns the subtree corresponding to the subject of the
sentence.  What should it do if the root node of the tree passed to
this function is not S, or it lacks a subject?
