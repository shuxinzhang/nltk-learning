â—‘ Write a recursive function that produces a nested bracketing for
a tree, leaving out the leaf nodes, and displaying the non-terminal
labels after their subtrees.  So the above example about Pierre
Vinken would produce:
[[[NNP NNP]NP , [ADJP [CD NNS]NP JJ]ADJP ,]NP-SBJ MD [VB [DT NN]NP [IN [DT JJ NN]NP]PP-CLR [NNP CD]NP-TMP]VP .]S
Consecutive categories should be separated by space.
