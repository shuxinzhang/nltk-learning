â˜¼ According to Strunk and White's Elements of Style,
the word however, used at the start of a sentence,
means "in whatever way" or "to whatever extent", and not
"nevertheless".  They give this example of correct usage:
However you advise him, he will probably do as he thinks best.

in the various texts we have been considering.
