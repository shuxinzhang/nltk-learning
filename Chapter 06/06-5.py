Select one of the classification tasks described in this chapter,
such as name gender detection, document classification,
part-of-speech tagging, or dialog act classification.  Using the
same training and test data, and the same feature extractor,
build three classifiers for the task: a decision tree, a naive
Bayes classifier, and a Maximum Entropy classifier.  Compare
the performance of the three classifiers on your selected task.
How do you think that your results might be different if you used
a different feature extractor?
