â—‘ Carry out the following evaluation tasks for
any of the chunkers you have developed earlier.
(Note that most chunking corpora contain some internal
inconsistencies, such that any reasonable rule-based approach
will produce errors.)
Evaluate your chunker on 100 sentences from a chunked corpus,
and report the precision, recall and F-measure.
Use the chunkscore.missed() and chunkscore.incorrect()
methods to identify the errors made by your chunker.  Discuss.
Compare the performance of your chunker to the baseline chunker
discussed in the evaluation section of this chapter.
