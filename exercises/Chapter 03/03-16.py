☼ Use a text editor to create a file
called prog.py containing the single line monty = 'Monty Python'.
Next, start up a new session with the
Python interpreter, and enter the expression monty at the prompt.
You will get an error from the interpreter. Now, try the following
(note that you have to leave off the .py part of the filename):




 

>>> from prog import monty
>>> monty



This time, Python should return with a value. You can also try
import prog, in which case Python should be able to
evaluate the expression prog.monty at the prompt.
