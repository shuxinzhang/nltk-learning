â—‘ Consider the numeric expressions in the following sentence from
the MedLine Corpus: The corresponding free cortisol fractions in these
sera were 4.53 +/- 0.15% and 8.16 +/- 0.23%, respectively.
Should we say that the numeric expression 4.53 +/- 0.15% is three
words?  Or should we say that it's a single compound word?  Or should
we say that it is actually nine words, since it's read "four point
five three, plus or minus zero point fifteen percent"?  Or should we say that
it's not a "real" word at all, since it wouldn't appear in any dictionary?
Discuss these different possibilities.  Can you think of application domains
that motivate at least two of these answers?
