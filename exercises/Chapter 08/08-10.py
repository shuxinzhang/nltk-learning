â˜¼ Use the graphical chart-parser interface to experiment with
different rule invocation strategies. Come up with your own strategy
that you can execute manually using the graphical interface. Describe
the steps, and report any efficiency improvements it has (e.g. in terms
of the size of the resulting chart). Do these improvements depend on
the structure of the grammar? What do you think of the prospects for
significant performance boosts from cleverer rule invocation
strategies?
