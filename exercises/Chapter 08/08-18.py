â—‘ Compare the performance of the top-down, bottom-up, and left-corner
parsers using the same grammar and three grammatical test
sentences. Use timeit to log the amount of time each
parser takes on the same sentence.  Write a function that runs all
three parsers on all three sentences, and prints a 3-by-3 grid of
times, as well as row and column totals. Discuss your findings.
