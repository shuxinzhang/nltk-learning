â—‘ Create a list of words and store it in a variable sent1.
Now assign sent2 = sent1.  Modify one of the items in sent1
and verify that sent2 has changed.

Now try the same exercise but instead assign sent2 = sent1[:].
Modify sent1 again and see what happens to sent2.  Explain.
Now define text1 to be a list of lists of strings (e.g. to
represent a text consisting of multiple sentences.  Now assign
text2 = text1[:], assign a new value to one of the words,
e.g. text1[1][1] = 'Monty'.  Check what this did to text2.
Explain.
Load Python's deepcopy() function (i.e. from copy import deepcopy),
consult its documentation, and test that it makes a fresh copy of any
object.
