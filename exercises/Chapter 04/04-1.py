â˜¼ Find out more about sequence objects using Python's help facility.
In the interpreter, type help(str), help(list), and help(tuple).
This will give you a full list of the functions supported by each type.
Some functions have special names flanked with underscore; as the
help documentation shows, each such function corresponds to something
more familiar.  For example x.__getitem__(y) is just a long-winded
way of saying x[y].
