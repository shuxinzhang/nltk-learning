â—‘ Initialize an n-by-m list of lists of empty strings using list
multiplication, e.g. word_table = [[''] * n] * m.  What happens
when you set one of its values, e.g. word_table[1][2] = "hello"?
Explain why this happens.  Now write an expression using range()
to construct a list of lists, and show that it does not have this problem.
