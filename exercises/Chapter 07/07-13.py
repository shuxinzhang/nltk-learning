Pick one of the three chunk types in the CoNLL corpus.  Write functions
to do the following tasks for your chosen type:
List all the tag sequences that occur with each instance of this chunk type.
Count the frequency of each tag sequence, and produce a ranked list in
order of decreasing frequency; each line should consist of an integer (the frequency)
and the tag sequence.
Inspect the high-frequency tag sequences.  Use these as the basis for
developing a better chunker.
