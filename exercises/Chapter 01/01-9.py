on lists and strings.

Define a string and assign it to a variable, e.g.,
my_string = 'My String' (but put something more interesting in the string).
Print the contents of this variable in two ways, first
by simply typing the variable name and pressing enter, then
by using the print statement.
Try adding the string to itself using my_string + my_string, or multiplying
it by a number, e.g., my_string * 3.  Notice that the strings
are joined together without any spaces.  How could you fix this?


'''

my_string = 'hello world!'
print my_string
print (my_string+(" "))*3
